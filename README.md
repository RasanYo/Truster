# Truster: Connect, Visit, Trust

Welcome to Truster, the innovative solution designed to make your relocation journey seamless and trustworthy. Truster connects you with locals (Trustees) in your prospective city who can visit apartments on your behalf. This unique service aims to save you time, money, and the hassle of dealing with potential scams.

## Project Overview

Truster is developed with a focus on providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for people planning to move. Our mobile app is built using React Native, and our web application is crafted with React, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. The project had to be stopped, but we're excited to share our codebase with the community.

### Features

Both our web and mobile applications share a core set of features:

- **Account Creation**: Sign up and log in functionality integrated with Firebase for secure authentication.

- **Profile Customization**: Easily update and modify your profile information to better match with suitable apartment visits.
- **Role Flexibility**: Upon signing up, you become a Truster by default. However, you have the option to take on the role of a Trustee, offering your local insights and visiting apartments for others.
- **Posting Visits**: As a Truster, you can create posts detailing your apartment visit needs, including location, budget, desired feedback timeline, housing type, and additional specifics.
- **Interactive Map/List**: Trustees can discover nearby visits through an intuitive interface, switching between map and list views to find suitable opportunities.
- **Connection and Communication**: Once a Trustee expresses interest in a visit and the Truster approves, both parties gain access to a private chat to coordinate further details.
- **Engagement**: Users can like posts to bookmark them for future reference and access their message history for ongoing communications.
