# Truster: Save efforts, let locals do your visits

Moving to a new city ? Having doubts about your new home offers ?
Save your time and your money, get someone living nearby to visit your new place before moving in.

Welcome to Truster, the innovative solution designed to make your relocation journey seamless and trustworthy. Truster connects you with locals (Trustees) in your prospective city who can visit apartments on your behalf. This unique service aims to save you time, money, and the hassle of dealing with potential scams.

## Project Overview

Truster is developed with a focus on providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for people planning to move. Our mobile app is built using React Native, and our web application is crafted with React, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. The project had to be stopped, but we're excited to share our codebase with the community.

### Features

Both our web and mobile applications share a core set of features:

- **Account Creation**: Sign up and log in functionality integrated with Firebase for secure authentication.
- **Profile Customization and Personal Dashboard**: Easily update and modify your profile information, and access all your personal details including your posts, upcoming visits, pending requests, and personal data, all in one convenient location.

- **Role Flexibility**: Upon signing up, you become a Truster by default. However, you have the option to take on the role of a Trustee, offering your local insights and visiting apartments for others.

- **Connection and Communication**: Once a Trustee expresses interest in a visit and the Truster approves, both parties gain access to a private chat to coordinate further details.
